1 maximize the beauty - fully channel the beauty with in. Maybe ask what makes this moment beautiful? See if beauty can be increased in every situation. MtB also could be taken as A use of reason and also a disciplining of the senses to focus on beauty (i.e. all the pretty flowers, all the pretty birds).

3 expect rising - this means our expectations are constantly rising. Kinda in line with "give em an inch they'll take a mile" also related to law of diminishing returns -"The law of diminishing returns states that in all productive processes, adding more of one factor of production, while holding all others constant ("ceteris paribus"), will at some point yield lower incremental per-unit returns." Tooo much ice cream too much cash

They can however minimize its effects. In my own life I am obliterated by friends and coworker’s snide remarks and judgments. How do I minimize its effects?
