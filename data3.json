MtB also could be taken as A use of reason and also a disciplining of the senses to focus on beauty (i.e. all the pretty flowers, all the pretty birds)."},

There are various techniques that help provide concentration and awareness in the passing moments within shorter intervals than traditional formal meditation. While using a timer to make sure you meditate for at least 10 minutes is helpful. A stopwatch to monitor your awareness of time and to also use time to monitor your concentration and awareness. A and C are essential to have Full Expression."

By tolerating mild forms of exploitation we soon begin to think if we are encroaching upon the slave mentality Nietzsche is so against. I find myself tolerating crappy food, living conditions, jobs, and relationships. Is there a reward for this or am I just making my life mediocre?"

                    "idea": "- intention vs non intention - Buddha says our intentions matter most when determining the value of an action while Neech says the opposite. Specifically, that we have our intentions but what comes out of that is the real meat of an action. Good example is my recent heart torturing break up. Nothing was intended to be so terrible but the reality was very painful for me. Thus judge me for letting tragedy strike me when I could have protected myself by 1) giving myself space 2) being aware of the possibilities of the situation better"

But his manner of demeaning women and Jews is just dumb. Also needlessly ambiguous over just how much he dislikes Jews. His dislike of women seems pretty clear but I bet he had some hope too."

In my opinion the fall is the best combination of fiction and philosophy ever written. For a while I loved Camus like no other but as of recent Iâ€™m kind of annoyed by his concept of absurdism. Its like \"yeah bro sure...life is absurd but is that the best way to describe life?\" In general existentialist thought seems to discount the need for pragmatic thought in most of the situations we encounter."
